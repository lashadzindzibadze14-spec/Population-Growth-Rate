Population Growth Determinants – Econometric Analysis
Project Overview

This project investigates the determinants of population growth across 217 countries using 2019 World Bank data (pre-COVID period).

A multiple linear regression model (OLS) was implemented to quantify the impact of:

Fertility Rate

Life Expectancy

Net Migration (scaled)

Regional Dummy Variable (Europe vs Non-Europe)

Methodology

Data cleaning and preprocessing performed in Excel

Dummy variable engineered for European countries

Net migration scaled for interpretability

OLS regression estimated in Stata

Statistical significance assessed via t-tests and F-test

Model explanatory power evaluated using R² (0.502)

Key Findings

Fertility rate has the strongest economic impact on population growth

European countries exhibit structurally lower growth rates

All predictors statistically significant at high confidence levels

Tools Used

Stata (OLS estimation)

Excel (data preprocessing)
